# Module 9A - React UserProfile Component

## Overview
This project is a simple React application built with Vite. It displays a `UserProfile` component that shows a name, bio, and profile image. The goal of the assignment was to practice creating and styling a basic React component using JSX.

## Key Features
- Created a reusable `UserProfile` component.
- Added inline CSS for simple styling.
- Rendered the component inside `App.jsx`.
- Set up the project using Vite for a fast development environment.

## What I Learned
- How to initialize a React app with Vite.
- How to write and use a functional React component.
- The basics of JSX and inline styling in React.
- How to structure components and render them in the main app file.

## Issues I Encountered
Initially, I ran into some confusion with setting up Vite and the correct file structure for React components. I fixed this by double-checking the tutorial instructions and testing small changes step by step.
